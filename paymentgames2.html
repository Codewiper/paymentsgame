• Diagrams (Mermaid‑ready)
• Edge cases
• Mathematical formulas
• Novelty arguments
• Related‑work section (including the arXiv reference)


You can paste this into Cursor or any coding assistant at any time to regenerate the full document.

⭐ MASTER PROMPT — SLA‑Aware Dynamic Scheduling Patent Specification

Save this. Use it whenever you want to regenerate the full patent document.

Copy/paste the following:

---

PROMPT START

I want you to generate a complete, comprehensive, patent‑ready document describing the following invention:

“SLA‑Aware Dynamic Queue Scheduling with Predictive Scaling and Pivot‑Based Monitoring.”

The document must include:

---

1. Executive Summary

A high‑level explanation of the invention and the problem it solves.

---

2. Problem Statement

Describe the challenges of multi‑queue, SLA‑driven systems such as payment processing:

• RTP, Wire, ACH, Checks
• Different SLAs
• Bursty traffic
• Starvation
• Inefficient static priority queues
• Reactive cloud scaling
• Sorting overhead


---

3. Core Invention Components

Explain the four key innovations in detail:

A. Dynamic Weights

Include the formula:

W_q = P_q + \alpha \cdot \frac{A_q}{S_q} + \beta \cdot L_q + \gamma \cdot R_q


Where:

• \(P_q\) = base priority
• \(A_q\) = age of oldest message
• \(S_q\) = SLA
• \(L_q\) = queue length
• \(R_q\) = arrival rate


Explain how this creates a real‑time urgency score.

---

B. Dynamic Batch Sizing

Include the formula:

B_q = B_{base} + \delta \cdot W_q


Explain how urgent queues get larger batches.

---

C. Predictive Scaling

Include formulas:

Time to clear:

T^{clear}_q = \frac{L_q}{B_q \cdot \text{ProcessingRate}}


Needed workers:

\text{NeededWorkers}_q = \frac{L_q}{S_q \cdot \text{ProcessingRate}}


Explain proactive scaling before SLA breach.

---

D. Pivot Monitoring

Explain how the system avoids sorting by tracking only:

• oldest timestamp
• newest timestamp
• queue length


Tie this to the “Breaking the Sorting Barrier” paper.

---

4. Related Work

Include a section referencing:

A. Bernstein, M. Parter, M. Tsourakakis
“Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths.”
arXiv:2504.17033

Explain how pivot‑based batching inspired this invention.

---

5. Detailed Architecture Description

Describe all components:

• Message Ingress
• Queue Manager
• Pivot Tracker
• Dynamic Weight Engine
• Batch Size Calculator
• Predictive Scaling Engine
• Worker Pool Manager
• Processing Layer


---

6. Mermaid Architecture Diagram

Provide a draw.io‑compatible Mermaid diagram with no formulas or special characters.

---

7. Edge Cases & Worked Examples

Include detailed numerical examples for:

• Normal balanced load
• RTP flood
• Wire SLA crisis
• ACH spike
• Checks flood


Each example must include:

• Inputs
• Weight changes
• Batch size changes
• Time‑to‑clear
• Scaling decisions


---

8. Novelty & Patentability Argument

Explain why the invention is:

• Novel
• Non‑obvious
• Useful
• Technically grounded
• Inspired by but distinct from graph algorithms


---

9. Patent‑Style Claims

Generate:

Independent Claim

A method claim covering:

• dynamic weights
• dynamic batch sizing
• predictive scaling
• pivot monitoring


Dependent Claims

Cover:

• formulas
• queue types
• cloud scaling
• pivot tracking
• batch sizing variations


---

10. Preferred Embodiment

Describe the payments‑specific embodiment:

• RTP
• Wire
• ACH
• Checks


---

11. Optional Embodiments

Describe how the invention generalizes to:

• microservices
• distributed systems
• cloud autoscaling
• workflow engines


---

12. Conclusion

Summarize the invention’s impact.

---

Important Requirements

• The document must be long, detailed, and professional.
• Use clear headings and subheadings.
• Include formulas in LaTeX.
• Include diagrams in Mermaid.
• Include all scenarios and edge cases.
• Tone should match a real patent disclosure.
• Do NOT include any code.


PROMPT END
